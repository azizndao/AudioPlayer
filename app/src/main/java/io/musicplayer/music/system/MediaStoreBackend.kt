/*
 * This file acts as the base for most the black magic required to get a remotely sensible music
 * indexing system while still optimizing for time. I would recommend you leave this file now
 * before you lose your sanity trying to understand the hoops I had to jump through for this system,
 * but if you really want to stay, here's a debrief on why this code is so awful.
 *
 * MediaStore is not a good API. It is not even a bad API. Calling it a bad API is an insult to
 * other bad android APIs, like CoordinatorLayout or InputMethodManager. No. MediaStore is a crime
 * against humanity and probably a way to summon Zalgo if you look at it the wrong way.
 *
 * You think that if you wanted to query a song's genre from a media database, you could just put
 * "genre" in the query and it would return it, right? But not with MediaStore! No, that's too
 * straightforward for this contract that was dropped on it's head as a baby. So instead, you have
 * to query for each genre, query all the songs in each genre, and then iterate through those songs
 * to link every song with their genre. This is not documented anywhere, and the O(mom im scared)
 * algorithm you have to run to get it working single-handedly DOUBLES Auxio's loading times. At no
 * point have the devs considered that this system is absolutely insane, and instead focused on
 * adding infuriat- I mean nice proprietary extensions to MediaStore for their own Google Play
 * Music, and of course every Google Play Music user knew how great that turned out!
 *
 * It's not even ergonomics that makes this API bad. It's base implementation is completely borked
 * as well. Did you know that MediaStore doesn't accept dates that aren't from ID3v2.3 MP3 files? I
 * sure didn't, until I decided to upgrade my music collection to ID3v2.4 and FLAC only to see that
 * the metadata parser has a brain aneurysm the moment it stumbles upon a dreaded TRDC or DATE tag.
 * Once again, this is because internally android uses an ancient in-house metadata parser to get
 * everything indexed, and so far they have not bothered to modernize this parser or even switch it
 * to something that actually works, not even in Android 12. ID3v2.4 has been around for *21
 * years.* *It can drink now.*
 *
 * Not to mention all the other infuriating quirks. Album artists can't be accessed from the albums
 * table, so we have to go for the less efficient "make a big query on all the songs lol" method so
 * that songs don't end up fragmented across artists. Pretty much every OEM has added some extension
 * or quirk to MediaStore that I cannot reproduce, with some OEMs (COUGHSAMSUNGCOUGH) crippling the
 * normal tables so that you're railroaded into their music app. I have to use a semi-deprecated
 * field to work with file paths, and the supposedly "modern" method is SLOWER and causes even more
 * problems since some devices just don't expose those fields for some insane reason. Sometimes
 * music will have a deformed clone that I can't filter out, sometimes Genres will just break for
 * no reason, and sometimes tags encoded in UTF-8 will be interpreted as anything from UTF-16 to
 * Latin-1 to *Shift JIS* WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
 *
 * Is there anything we can do about it? No. Google has routinely shut down issues that begged
 * google to fix glaring issues with MediaStore or to just take the API behind the woodshed and
 * shoot it. Largely because they have zero incentive to improve it given how "obscure" local music
 * listening is. As a result, Auxio exposes an option to use an internal parser based on ExoPlayer
 * that at least tries to correct the insane metadata that this API returns, but not only is that
 * system horrifically slow and bug-prone, it also faces the even larger issue of how google keeps
 * trying to kill the filesystem and force you into their ContentResolver API. In the future
 * MediaStore could be the only system we have, which is also the day that greenland melts and
 * birthdays stop happening forever.
 *
 * I'm pretty sure nothing is going to happen and MediaStore will continue to be neglected and
 * probably deprecated eventually for a "new" API that just coincidentally excludes music indexing.
 * Because go screw yourself for wanting to listen to music you own. Be a good consoomer and listen
 * to your AlgoPop StreamMixâ„¢.
 *
 * I wish I was born in the neolithic.
