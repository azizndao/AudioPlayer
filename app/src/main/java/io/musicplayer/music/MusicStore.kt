/**
 * The main storage for music items.
 *
 * Whereas other apps load music from MediaStore as it is shown, Auxio does not do that, as it
 * cripples any kind of advanced metadata functionality. Instead, Auxio loads all music into a
 * in-memory relational data-structure called [Library]. This costs more memory-wise, but is also
 * much more sensible.
 *
 * The only other, memory-efficient option is to create our own hybrid database that leverages both
 * a typical DB and a mem-cache, like Vinyl. But why would we do that when I've encountered no real
 * issues with the current system.
 *
 * [Library] may not be available at all times, so leveraging [Callback] is recommended. Consumers
 * should also be aware that [Library] may change while they are running, and design their work
 * accordingly.
