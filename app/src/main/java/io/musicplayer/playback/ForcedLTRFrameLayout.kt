/**
 * A class that programmatically overrides the child layout to a left-to-right (LTR) layout
 * direction.
 *
 * The Material Design guidelines state that any components that represent a "Timeline" should
 * always be LTR. In Auxio, this applies to most of the playback components. This layout in
 * particular overrides the layout direction in a way that will not disrupt how other views are laid
 * out.
 *
 * This layout can only contain one child.
